# AnimalityOS
Robotic Operating System for animalityOS


## Overview
This project demonstrates how to integrate Robot Operating System (ROS) applications with Kubernetes, enabling scalable and fault-tolerant deployment of robotic systems in a distributed environment. By leveraging Kubernetes' container orchestration capabilities, developers can efficiently manage ROS nodes, services, and resources across clusters of machines.

## Features
- Deployment of ROS nodes as Kubernetes pods
- Customization of ROS launch configuration for Kubernetes
- Scalability and fault tolerance through Kubernetes controllers
- Monitoring and logging with Prometheus and Grafana
- Documentation and best practices for ROS-Kubernetes integration

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the ROS-Kubernetes integration project:

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your local machine
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster set up and configured
- Basic knowledge of ROS and Kubernetes concepts

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/ros-kubernetes-integration.git
   # link has /username/, replacing it with /catdavid/ username returns 404. Cannot get access to this repo.
   cd ros-kubernetes-integration
   ```

2. Build Docker images for your ROS nodes:
   ```
   docker build -t ros-node:latest .
   ```

3. Deploy ROS nodes on Kubernetes:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

4. Monitor the deployment using Kubernetes dashboard or command-line tools:
   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```

5. Access ROS nodes using Kubernetes services:
   ```
   kubectl get svc
   ```

## Customization
You can customize the ROS-Kubernetes integration project according to your specific requirements and use cases. Some possible customization options include:

- Adding additional ROS nodes and services
- Configuring resource constraints for Kubernetes pods
- Integrating with external systems or sensors
- Extending monitoring and logging capabilities
